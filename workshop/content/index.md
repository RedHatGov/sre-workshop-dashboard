# OpenShift Site Reliability Engineering

## Description 

Enterprises and agencies have begun to modernize their application portfolio on new platforms like OpenShift, and as a result operations teams have begun to shift to new ways of managing their applications and platforms. Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is one way to implement the DevOps paradigm of managing systems and has become increasingly popular since Google published their book _Site Reliability Engineering_, which defined how they implement and use the methodology. 

Of the 8 tenets of SRE that Google laid out in their book, this workshop will focus on the following:

* Monitoring
* Change management
* Efficiency and Performance

While the other 5 tenets will not be directly addressed, attendees should be able to apply what they've learned in the workshop to many of them.

## Who should attend

The workshop is ideal for engineers who bootstrap, monitor, and manage platform environments for other teams that build and deploy applications.  Related role titles include Site Reliability Engineers, DevOps Engineers, Infrastructure Engineers, or others.  You must be fluent with the fundamentals of containers and OpenShift.  Knowledge of OpenShift Service Mesh is helpful but not required.

## What you will learn

SRE and DevOps is a large and broad topic which cannot be covered in the course of one workshop, so we have constructed a few scenarios to allow engineers to apply SRE practices to systems running on top of the OpenShift platform. The goal is to familiarize you with SRE principles and the tools necessary to identify, triage, and remediate failure situations that a team might encounter when running their systems on OpenShift.

## Introduction
Welcome to the workshop!

If you are on-site with us, the instructor will walk you through and kick off each lab.  Otherwise, if you're running this on your own, just go through the list of labs in order (as some build off of each other).

These labs have been tailored for OpenShift 4.x

# OCP SRE 
### OpenShift Container Platform Site Reliability Engineer

## Description 

As enterprises and agencies modernize their application portfolios on new platforms, customers have become accustomed to having access and availability to their content from a variety of sources.  These two factors have driven operations teams to exploring new ways of managing their applications and platforms. 

The SRE is one way to implement the DevOps paradigm of managing systems to help maintain focus on engineering work, as opposed to operations work, and has become increasingly popular since Google published their book _Site Reliability Engineering_, which defined how they implement and use the methodology.

Of the 8 tenets of SRE that Google laid out in their book, this workshop will focus on the following:

* Monitoring
* Change management
* Efficiency 
* Performance

While the other 4 tenets (availability, latency, emergency response, and capacity planning) will not be directly addressed, attendees should be able to apply what they've learned in this workshop to many of them.

## Audience (Who should attend)

The workshop is ideal for engineers who bootstrap, monitor, and manage platform environments for other teams that build and deploy applications.  
Related role titles which would find this workshop useful include Site Reliability Engineers, DevOps Engineers, Infrastructure Engineers, and others.  
You must be fluent with the fundamentals of containers and container orchestration as well as have a fundamental understanding and have used OpenShift.  
Knowledge of OpenShift Service Mesh is helpful but not required.

## Expectation (What you will learn)

SRE and DevOps is a large and broad topic which cannot be covered in the course of one workshop, so we have constructed a few scenarios to allow engineers to apply SRE practices to systems running on top of the OpenShift platform. The goal is to familiarize you with SRE principles and the tools necessary to identify, triage, and remediate failure situations that a team might encounter when running their systems on OpenShift.

## Getting Started
Welcome to the workshop!

If you are on-site with us, the instructor will walk you through and kick off each lab.  

Otherwise, if you're running this on your own, just go through the list of labs in order (as some build off of each other).

These labs have been tailored for OpenShift 4.x
